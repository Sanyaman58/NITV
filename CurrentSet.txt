Scary monster in the dark
Holy crap!
I didn't really see it.
Please don't listen.
Will tunnel fish be always there?
Will tunnel drain, canal be bare?
I would miss the tunnel fish.
To have them back would be my wish.
Are they gonna drain the tunnel or something?
No. It's poetry, ok?
I'm just making stuff up!
Please don't listen!!!
When winter come and water freeze
Here the fish can be at ease
The tunnel is not flooded ruin
It's a home, a place for doin'
Sure. That works.
Please go away.
Cool that people still hang around down here.
We used to do that when I was in highschool.
Yeah.
I wasn’t in high school that long ago, you know.
How old are you?
20!
Oh so you can’t buy beer.
...No.
Do you have a car?
...No.
Hm.
Hey kids!
Hey adult.
Well I was your age only a few years ago.
Uh huh.
...
Well, see ya later!
Rainy day, huh.
But not down here.
You kids have your own little secret hideout down here, huh. :)
Pfft.
Whatever.
:|
When I was a kid - 
Literally nobody cares.
Well - :(
Whatever.
... :|
Okay then.
Hey... Uh... Kind of a weird question, but
Is anyone missing?
What?
Like anyone you know who was out last night
And didn't come back?
Uh.
I don't think so?
What's going on?
Nothing. Thought I saw something.
Ok... Uh...
You should tell us if this is something.
Just be careful, ok? Keep an eye out
And let me know if you see anything weird, ok?
I mean you all hang out together constantly.
You're safer than anyone else I know!
...
So like... Are you *always* together?
Yeah I guess.
That's cool. Friends are cool.
Safer.
Safer?
Yeah, like the buddy system.
Safety in numbers!!!
You're a little paranoid, you know that?
Kid, you don't even know.
Anyone hear anything about anyone around here missing?
Uh, yeah actually.
There's some girl I know online
She hasn't been on since Harfest.
Ok well I think we might need a bit more than that.
Ok.
Is she from here? I could ask my aunt...
Some place called mulvay
!!!!
*mulvay*? \o/
You know someone from *mulvay*?
Yeah?
Do you know where mulvay is? _o_
Do you know *what* mulvay is?
No...
I heard about mulvay.
My dad drives a bread truck.
Mulvay used to be one of his stops.
What happened?
He don't stop there no more.
They had to pay some other guy to do it.
Sounds about right.
What's mulvay?
I'll take you out there this weekend.
Don't.
It'll be fine. We'll just drive through.
...
I need to go get back in the sun now.
Hey you guys.
Yeah?
Stay safe, alright?
Wow. Thanks mom.
Are you our new mom?
Apparently.
Life, man. It goes.
Slowly
Nah, dude.
Nah.
Hey teens.
Hey.
What are you guys doing?
...
...
Nothing.
Cool!
Where is everybody?
*mmf**mmf*
What?
*mmf**mmf*
Oh my God. We used to do that. Awesome.
*mmf**mmf**mmf*
Well you go easy on my street.
*mmf**mmfmmffmffff*
Deal
Hello? Are you dead?
Did you get run over?
Nah kid I’m just fixin' 'er up.
Isn't it dangerous to be under a car on a hill?
I do not fear death, kid.
Adult.
Death fears me.
Yeah ok but
I'll drive this car right over the grim reaper.
Ok.
Do you live here or something?
Yeah kid, rekkage manor is right behind you.
Adult.
Wait a sec- are you Rick Rekkage?
Like, the creeping deadlies Rick Rekkage?
Yeah kid. I’m him. He’s me.
How’s the band?
Great. Playin' out. Free beer.
Stop by the bar some night and see us!
I’m not 21 yet.
Aw don't worry kid. You'll be a real person soon.
Adu-
Whatever.
Watching squirrels. Squirrels are weird.
They're really just fancy rats.
How much of it?
All of it. Every last drop of sweet, sweet child bloooood.
Are you a monster lady?
The most monster of all ladies.
My mom says I'm not supposed to talk to you.
Why?
Because one time you hurt somebody and no one knows when you might do it again.
That was a long time ago.
She says you had a lot going for you but you threw it in the garbage.
Your mom sounds great.
She says you didn't even try when you went to college
And now you've blown your only chance to avoid living in an abandoned train car.
Wow, kid. Is your mom going to publish a newsletter?
I'm not going to talk to you if that's ok.
Tell your mom I said hey.
If he falls through one of my windows I will not hesitate to take legal action. 
Who? 
Him! Up there on the roof next door! 
If he falls from that roof through a window 
You're going to have to pick which part of him you're going to sue. 
Whichever piece is biggest. 
I can hear you, you know! 
Stupid Bear. 
I remember when Bea's family had a house and not a tiny depressing apartment. 
Arnold Applebaum. 
Owned the mining company like a thousand years ago. 
Dad said he was a crook who hated the unions. 
But we did get a library! 
...That got turned into apartments! 
Hm. Don't think I've ever read this plaque before. 
Arnold a. Applebaum. 
"A father to all workers," 
"A grandfather to their children," 
"A great-grandfather to those children's children..." 
It keeps going like that for awhile. 
Erected 1910. 
Bea has this dude right outside her window. 
Constantly. 
Arnold Stalkerbaum. 
And if we don't *start* getting businesses in here
There ain't gonna *be* a Possum Springs.
So we gotta do whatever we can do
To get the market to notice us!
Can we get back to the topic at hand?
Yeah, so we allocate funds to preserve the statue of-
Gary, you're not hearing me.
Don't tell me I'm not hearing you, andrew.
It's not. Of. Sufficient. Historical. Note.
Your ass is not of sufficient historical note!!!!
Guys, guys. Stop this.
This is the stoplight fight all over again.
Oh yeah? And remember who won that one?
Can we move on?
Fine.
Fine.
Hello.
Whatcher doin' on my porch?
If he falls through one of my windows I will not hesitate to take legal action. 
Who? 
Him! Up there on the roof next door! 
<o> 
If he falls from that roof through a window 
-_- 
You're going to have to pick which part of him you're going to sue. 
Whichever piece is biggest. 
O_o 
I can hear you, you know! 
_o_ 
I don't remember inviting you up here. 
Sorry. 
This is awful familiar of you. 
Ghosts. 
See I'd just leave my laundry out on rainy days.
It's like a cheap wash!
Wonder if the squirrels ever steal undies?
I should start doing my own laundry.
Sometime.
This is my property.
But it's myyyyyy street!
You ain't changed since you was a kid.
I can legally shoot you for being up here, ya know?
Ha ha you'd never
I used to babysit your cat.
Ehhhhhh.
My cat don't like folks on the porch.
Yer gonna make my dog anxious,
And she poops a lot when she's anxious.
Don't touch my pumpkin.
The missus varnished this porch herself.
Don't go trackin' mud all over it.
I play a mean banjo. Clawhammer.
Really? I play bass.
We should play together sometime!
You know long black veil?
Yep!
You know Tom Dooley?
Yep! My dad likes that stuff!
You know willer garden?
Nope!
Eh.
Bad weather comin' soon.
I feel it in my bones.
Getting cold early this year.
Don't bode well.
Snow comin'.
Gonna be bad this year.
Alright I'm gonna run interference while you do your thing. 
What do you mean? 
I'm gonna distract the clerk. I can do this. 
Ok I will admit that drawing attention is a talent you have. 
I'm great at crimes. 
But what if I get caught? 
You won't. I'll just start screaming if I have to. 
How is that a good idea? 
Let's go. 
Ok but if this goes wrong I'm blaming you. 
Join the club. 
Hmmm... 
Wow. Haven't seen belt buckles in awhile. 
At least not fashionable ones. 
Mike at the shop has one with a rattlesnake driving a semi truck. 
Ok. I'm gonna do this. 
Do what? 
Cover me. I'm gonna grab one. 
What?! No!! 
Shhhh!!! 
You are *not* doing this. 
Shut up and let's get out of here. 
Heyyyyyyy. 
Uh huh. 
I’ve got a question. 
Tshirts are 20 percent off. 
Yeah I saw. I was wondering about something else... 
Ok. 
The name of this store... 
Yeah? 
Ha ha. You probably get this question a lot 
Try me. 
You know, no one ever asks this but I think about it all the time. 
I bet! 
*God* 
You know what the official business name on our checks is? 
Urevolution: radical “uth” culture uprising inc 
Not really. Anyway, did you want something? 
Uh... Ok...  
You alright? 
Oh God I know. 
Like guys can’t we just a be a store that sells cool shit to teens? 
Yeah. Teens go nuts for this shit. 
The employee discount is also pretty great. 
I had a job once. 
Had a 100 percent discount. 
Uh huh. 
When I stooooole shiiiiiit! 
No I got what you meant the first time. 
I bet you grab things all the time. 
Well they’re big into prosecuting to the fullest extent of the law here, so- 
Ok I’m done looking let’s go 
Okitwasnicetalkingtoyoubyenow 
Uh... See ya 
Are you one of those undercover shoppers?  
Do I look like I’m an undercover shopper? 
We get those sometimes. Checking in on us. 
Making sure you don’t steal anything. 
Yeah they’re big into prosecuting to the fullest extent of the law 
What? 
I have no idea. 
Let me know if you need anything. 
So, 
Hrrrrrrrrrngh 
Uh.... 
Uh... Are you flirting with me? 
Um. 
Oh, it’s ok. I feel you. 
Ma’am, I have work to do. 
Crap. 
It’s ok. I was really awkward until I met Dennis. 
“Dennis”? 
Yeah he works at that prison over in briddle. 
He used to come in to get plugs. 
We’re gonna get hitched one of these days. 
Wait, Dennis Durham? From Possum Springs? 
Uh... Yeah, how did you know? 
I think he was married to a girl I know. 
He might actually still be married? I don’t know their situation. 
What?! 
Uh. Ok. 
Goddammit. 
You know what? It’s fine. 
Oh good. 
Yeah. 
At first you weirded me out but now I’m wondering why this hasn’t happened before. 
I’m sure someday the right customer will harass you. 
I don’t even think you made it to harassment. 
Yeah that ground to a halt pretty quick. 
About what? 
You’re a cutie! 
Let’s go to the food court! 
Let’s see that employee discount! 
Is... Is this how you normally try to flirt? 
...Yes. 
You should work on that. 
Eh. 
Alright, where did that come from? 
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!!!! 
Uh... 
Are you... Do you have issues? 
No, but you effin’ do. 
Ok look I mean I’ve had some problems too. 
But I found a lot of peace in God. 
Oh good. Good. That’s what I need. 
Do you need something? 
... 
I don’t know... 
My life made sense until recently 
But now it’s all effed up. 
Can I pray for you? 
Ok do you have problems? 
Do you need me to call someone? 
Don’t change the subject! 
I’ll eff you up! 
What is your problem?! 
I don’t know! I haven’t gotten that far yet! 
What?! 
Uh ok I’m going to call security. 
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaghghg!!!! 
Ok so we don’t have security but I am calling the cops. 
No don’t do that I’ll stop 
What is wrong with you?!? 
Neither angels nor our lord above could persuade me to go farther than neutral! 
Nay, nay! I command thee with the authority of heaven! 
Hark! What distraction is this? 
We bless thee, lord, for hearing the prayers of your humble servant. 
What spell hath been cast upon my poor brain? 
...Because it's not "Sticking it to the man" 
"The man" isn't going to lose anything here. 
But she will get in a lot of trouble. 
She's just a cog in a much bigger machine, huh? 
Sure. Whatever. Return the shit. 
Ok ok I'm going. 
Hi. 
Hello. 
You're back. 
Yeah we stole some shit. 
Here is that shit. 
We don't want you to get in trouble with your boss. 
It's not your fault the world is like it is. 
What? You stole this? 
You're just a cog in a much bigger machine. 
To blame you would be like blaming a thing inside a whole thing. 
So you're returning stolen merchandise? 
One day folks like you are going to overthrow the whole thing. 
What whole thing? 
The. Whole. Thing. 
We're leaving. 
Stay strong you Beautiful dreamer. You have nothing to lose but your chains. 
What? 
Hey ladies. 
:) o/ 
Helllloooooooo lady. 
_o_ 
Just so you know, we have 20 percent off select tshirts. 
Oooh! Tshirts! 
Yep. 
Thanks a lot! 
Ok. 
Catch you later! O/ 
Alright.

Oh for God's sake.

I'm 14 again. 
Yep. Pretty nuts in here. 
_o_ o_o 
Hey isn't that-

Shut up. 
O_o 
Ha ha niiiiice. 
Dead party boys stickers? In 2017? 
I think they're back in. 
Hm. That's cool. 
I bet you listen to them. 
Um. Yeah. They're good. 
Yeah if you're 30 years old and sad. 
I'm getting there. 
They don't even have any witchdagger stuff here. 
They only have stuff that's cool with like 
13 year olds. 
Isn't that a witchdagger blacklight poster? 
Oh. Huh. 
Looks like they have a few of them. 
I think I saw a whole witchdagger thing on the way in. 
Ok, ok. 
You should go hang out with the 13 year olds. 
Stop it. 
You have so much in common. 
I swear I will steal your car and leave you here. 
Heh heh. Like you even know how to drive. 
Nightshift, huh? That's cool.
I'm at home with my baby during the day
Until my mom gets back from work?
Ew, babies.
Pretty cool job, though?
Get to watch movies, eat candy, meet cute guys?
Ew, cute guys.
What's wrong with guys?
I dunno. Cute guys are overrated.
Hey, Mae!
How's the laptop running?
Really good! Thanks so much!
Glad to be of service.
So, like...
Yeah?
More people than you'd think!
Older people who don’t know any better.
Kids who for some reason can't get something.
Do you ever want to tell them?
What, about the internet?
About rental by mail?
Yeah.
Mae, it's not my job to save them
I am paid to stand here, assist when needed,
Take their money, and not openly judge them.
There's a certain romance to vhs and dvd
That simply cannot be matched.
... Really?
Nope.
Wait, you actually have vhs?
Mostly the adult section back behind the curtain.
Whoa, really?
Yeah some folks are like really into seeking them out.
It's like a whole little scene that goes back before the internet.
We had a historian in there last month looking for some obscure video.
How do you get that job?
I think that's the kind of job you can only have
If you don’t need to have a job.
So this party tonight, huh?
Yeah. Should be fun?
I hadn't pegged you as a party person.
I'm not really. But parties with Gregg are different.
How so?
You know how you want to just go and stand in a corner sometimes?
Yeah.
Gregg's my corner.
